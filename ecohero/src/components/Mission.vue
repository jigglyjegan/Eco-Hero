    <div class="about-card">
      <p>
        We want to tackle the issue of climate change head-on by encouraging companies to 
        keep track of their emissions. We hope that this way, companies can find a way to
        make profits sustainably while ensuring a bright future for our future generations.
      </p>
      <p>
        We believe that every little bit saved is a step closer towards saving our
        Earth.

        Executing environmental, social and governance effectively can help companies combat rising operating expenses 
        (such as raw-material costs and the true cost of water or carbon), which
         McKinsey research has found can affect operating profits by as much as <b>60 percent.</b>

        <b>There’s more carbon dioxide in our atmosphere than at any time in human history.</b>

        In February and March 2021, sensors at the Mauna Loa observatory 
        in Hawaii – which has tracked Earth’s atmospheric concentration of CO2 
        since the late 1950s – detected CO2 concentrations of more than 417 parts per million (ppm)
